## Project Description

**TravelPlanner** is an AI-powered travel planning application that transforms users' simple notes and preferences into detailed, structured travel itineraries.

- **AI-Powered Plan Generation**: Generates detailed travel plans based on user notes and preferences using AI models accessed via OpenRouter.ai.
- **Detailed Plan Output**: Presents plans in a clear format, including activities, estimated costs, ratings, and restaurant suggestions.
- **User Feedback**: Allows users to rate generated plans to help improve the service.
